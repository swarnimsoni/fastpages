An example with annotating mathematical expressions/equations is following: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/522517/annotate-math-equation-with-text-on-arrows-around-the-equation . . However, this is quite complicated. The annotation text could be added to the equation with any image editing tool. . with simple LaTeX only . $$ underbrace{ theta_{j}}_{New ; theta_j} leftarrow overbrace{ theta_j}^{Old ; theta_j} - underbrace{ alpha}_{learning ; rate } * overbrace{ frac { partial J( theta)}{ partial theta_j}}^{Gradient} $$ . It could be even colour coded . $$ color{blue}{ underbrace{ theta_{j}}_{New ; theta_j} } leftarrow color{green}{ overbrace{ theta_j}^{Old ; theta_j}} - color{yellow}{ underbrace{ alpha}_{learning ; rate } } * color{red}{ overbrace{ frac { partial J( theta)}{ partial theta_j}}^{Gradient}} $$ with Image Editing tool . Another method to annotate an eqation is to use some image editting tool like photoshop/gimp, to creat something like following . . Mathematical equations . Mathematical expressions/LaTeX environments are supported by Jupyter/Colab as well as FastPages. . begin{equation} frac{1}{ Bigl( sqrt{ phi sqrt{5}}- phi Bigr) e^{ frac25 pi}} = 1+ frac{e^{-2 pi}} {1+ frac{e^{-4 pi}} {1+ frac{e^{-6 pi}} {1+ frac{e^{-8 pi}} {1+ ldots} } } } end{equation} You can import your own data into Colab notebooks from your Google Drive account, including from spreadsheets, as well as from Github and many other sources. To learn more about importing data, and how Colab can be used for data science, see the links below under Working with Data. . Code and Run . Running Jupyter notebook is far easier as compared to FastPages. FastPages requires setting up docker environment on personal computer. . Visualization . Fastpages just copies visualizations/charts/graphs from Jupyter notebook, however, only altair charts remain interactive in fastpages, others become static. . Here are some random charts with different libraries. . with Altair . %%capture #install altair package !pip3 install cite2c altair vega_datasets . import altair as alt from vega_datasets import data source = data.cars() alt.Chart(source).mark_circle(size=60).encode( x=&#39;Horsepower&#39;, y=&#39;Miles_per_Gallon&#39;, color=&#39;Origin&#39;, tooltip=[&#39;Name&#39;, &#39;Origin&#39;, &#39;Horsepower&#39;, &#39;Miles_per_Gallon&#39;] ).interactive() . with pyplot . %matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #plt.isinteractive() plt.figure() plt.grid(True) plt.scatter(source[&#39;Horsepower&#39;],source[&#39;Miles_per_Gallon&#39;]) plt.xlabel(&#39;Horsepower&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Miles_per_Gallon&#39;) plt.show() . with Seaborn . import seaborn as sns sns.scatterplot(source[&#39;Horsepower&#39;],source[&#39;Miles_per_Gallon&#39;]) sns. . /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/seaborn/_decorators.py:43: FutureWarning: Pass the following variables as keyword args: x, y.

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
